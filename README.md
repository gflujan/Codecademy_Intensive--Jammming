# Spotify Playlist Maker 

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1b63b02e-5dd1-46a4-a0dc-d01330556ded/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/spotify-pm/deploys)

## A Spotify playlist utility that was made with `create-react-app`. 

This app uses the following: 

1. React (frontend) 
2. Spotify (API / data) 
3. Netlify (deployment) 
4. Yarn v2 (project package management)

## About 

This app was originally a small pet project that I was doing for educational purposes, but after starting to use Spotify more, I realized that it was actually pretty handy. Spotify's built-in option for creating playlists is tedious. So I decided to flesh this out and put it out into the wild for others to use. ðŸ™‚ 

## How It Works 

The interface is straight forward, first you log into your Spotify account. 

Then, once you're logged in, you enter in a song, album or artist name to `search` and get back some results (on the left). If you like what you see, click on the `+` button to add some songs to the playlist (on the right). 

If you accidentally added a song, or decided you don't want one after all, click on the `-` in the playlist section and, ðŸ’¥, it's gone. 

If you don't like what you have, and want to start all over, hit the `clear all` button and go again. Easy peasy! 

Once you have all the songs you want, give the playlist a name and hit that `save` button.
